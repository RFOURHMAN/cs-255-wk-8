Investigation and preparation in a methodical manner Because of the nature of my contribution to this project, I had to put myself in the mindset of a member of the staff at a modest consulting firm that designed both software and hardware solutions for a wide variety of customers. 
The person in charge of the project was the one who was responsible for bringing in DriverPass as a new customer for the company. The purpose of the DriverPass program is to improve students' readiness for driving exams by providing them with the opportunity to participate in behind-the-wheel instruction and providing them with access to online practice tests that replicate real-world driving conditions. 
One of their requirements was that the system be capable of ensuring that the location in question is in possession of the most recent version of the training and rules that are in line with the local DMV. This was one of the requirements that the system needed to meet. 
Important features include the ability to send push alerts, compatibility with a range of operating systems, and the availability of a scheduling system that allows students to manage their time with driving instructors. (Ready to be used on desktop computers as well as mobile devices) 
I believe that I performed a satisfactory job with the project as a whole, despite the fact that my familiarity with all of the user needs and my capacity to include them may use some further work. I was able to take into account all of the requirements of the users.
And it is to those spots that I would go back to and patch up, which requires identifying all user interfaces and providing the appropriate non-functional needs where they are required. It could be good to have a conversation with the customer, or in this instance to read a transcript of that encounter, in order to obtain an idea of where the consumer originates from and what they want to achieve with their product.
And with respect to the production personnel, it may prove to be of great use in terms of the design to make an attempt to appreciate the endeavor from their point of view. When it came to my strategy, I made it a point to explain everything in the most straightforward and rational manner possible. To ensure that my strategy would be as successful as it could possibly be, I concentrated on the stages of the system that an end user, an administrator, or a member of the staff would go through. 
I did this so that my method would be as efficient as it could possibly be. Working in an incremental approach is successful for me. Keeping everything clean, nice, and in order, especially in my case after laying the project down for a few days and going back to it, helps me to quickly assess where I am in the process and what needs to be done next. Keeping everything clean, neat, and in order is especially important after putting the project down for a few days and coming back to it.
After setting the task aside for a few days and picking it back up again, it is very vital to ensure that everything is kept in a beautiful and orderly fashion.
